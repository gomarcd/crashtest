## Security

:white_check_mark: No telemetry, ads or trackers

:white_check_mark: Runs locally on your machine, the only data ever going out are queries explicitly sent by user

:white_check_mark: Code signing: macOS binaries are signed with official Apple certificate issued by Developer ID Certification Authority, Windows binaries will be code signed via Azure Trusted Signing pending its identity validation

:white_check_mark: GPG signing: macOS, Windows and Linux binares are always GPG-signed with ed25519 key `A65E9AE2` (Fingerprint: `1353 E058 CB77 A738 F6AE  3362 883E 797A A65E 9AE2`), so you can verify the downloaded files are indeed from me. To verify with this method make sure you have GPG installed first. You can then download the pubkey from:

- Here in this repo by clicking `gpg-pubkey.asc` above or click [here](https://github.com/gomarcd/crashtest/blob/main/gpg-pubkey.asc) and then run `gpg --import gpg-pubkey.asc`
- From Ubuntu keyserver with `gpg --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 1353E058CB77A738F6AE3362883E797AA65E9AE2` or by [clicking here](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=ci%40crashtest.app&fingerprint=on&op=index)
- From openpgp.org with `gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys 1353E058CB77A738F6AE3362883E797AA65E9AE2` or by [clicking here](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=1353E058CB77A738F6AE3362883E797AA65E9AE2)

Verify GPG signature with:

- Download the release file (e.g., Crashtest_2025.0.0.1_universal.dmg) and its corresponding .sig file (Crashtest_2025.0.0.1_universal.dmg.sig) into the same directory.
- Run the following command in that directory ensuring filenames match what you downloaded: `gpg --verify Crashtest_2025.0.0.1_universal.dmg.sig Crashtest_2025.0.0.1_universal.dmg`, you should get output like this:

```
gpg: Signature made Sun  6 Apr 11:52:54 2025 MDT
gpg:                using EDDSA key 1353E058CB77A738F6AE3362883E797AA65E9AE2
gpg: Good signature from "Crashtest CI <ci@crashtest.app>" 
```

:white_check_mark: SHA256 checksums accompany downloads for every release so you can verify the integrity of the file

- To verify manually (make sure filenames matche what you downloaded):
    1. Calculate the checksum: `sha256sum Crashtest_2025.0.0.1_universal.dmg`
    2. Display the expected checksum from the downloaded `.sha256` file: `cat Crashtest_2025.0.0.1_universal.dmg.sha256`
    3. Compare the long hash string output by the first command to the hash string displayed by the second command. They must match exactly.
